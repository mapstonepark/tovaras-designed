# Personal Contact Management Tool
A contact management tool that you can use to keep track of your personal relationships. Add an individual to your crew, give them a logline that tells you a little informationa bout them, and then add notes as you interact with them.

## How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS JavaScript, EJS for templating, MongoDB for database, NodeJS

Started with a basic todo model and increased the schema to include extra details. The front end was inspired by mobile first design as the default way this app is expected to be used is to pull out when you are meeting up or leaving hangouts. Quickly tap out information to log the new detaisl as quickly as possible. Used MVC to keep information seperated and easier to track changes. 

## Optimimazations
Would add a section for an image to represent a contact. 
Auto-stamp date for new notes added for a contact. 
Desktop features to easily edit and add tags for contacts
Ability to search through notes
